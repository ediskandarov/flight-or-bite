# Handoff log

Newest entry last. After every finished step: what was done, where the artefacts are, what is next,
what waits for the author. Committed together with the step.

## 2026-09-20 18:40 — state restored after the context overflow; PREREG frozen

- Done: step (a) smoke on dev (`runs/online_smoke/`, 25/25 episodes, was already finished by the previous session); uncommitted work split into `7fcdf8b` (format only) and `799fc0f` (online runner, `validation/confirm.py`, Jev table sessions); new: `fob latency bench/show` (`timing/bench.py`), `fob confirm`, `fob confirm-h5` (`validation/confirm_h5.py`), all crash-tested offline (mock Jev, seeds shifted by +50 000 000; `runs/confirm_smoke/`). Tests no longer write into `runs/`.
- Step (b) done: `PREREG.md` is `Status: FROZEN`, 14 hashes match (`prereg.check()` passes). Decisions D58-D62.
- Jev ledger: 9 343 of 100 000. No access to `test` so far (`runs/test_access.log` does not exist).
- A leftover `git stash` entry ("wip before format split") is a redundant copy of `799fc0f`; safe to drop.
- Next: (c) `reports/run_instructions.md`; (d) `fob confirm`, connectome table; (e) Jev tables pass 1, `fob confirm-h5`; pass 2 not earlier than 12 h after pass 1 ends; (f) `fob report` (still a stub - to be written).
- Waits for the author: nothing blocks. Open to reversal: D60-D62.
